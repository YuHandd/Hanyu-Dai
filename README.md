## Overview

### Learning Objectives

- Use Git can be used to manage source code (documentation source code)
- Use SSH to access GitHub
- Use HTTPS to access GitHub
- Learn about the rich GitHub ecosystem for software development
- Gain familiarity with GitHub Actions

## Background

Please read and understand the [background](./Background.md) material on Git and GitHub.  

Become familiar with Secure Shell (SSH) and how it can be used to access a remote Git repository by reading [this](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh) documentation.

## üìù Tasks

1. Add your "@udayton.edu" email to your GitHub account.  It does not need to be your primary email in the account.
1. Enable two factor (2FA) on your GitHub account to secure it properly.
1. Create your profile README. Let the world know a little bit more about you! What are you interested in learning? What are you working on? What's your favorite hobby? Learn more about creating your profile README in the document, ["Managing Your Profile README"](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/managing-your-profile-readme).
1. Create a SSH key pair on your primary computer.  Upload the SSH public key to your GitHub.com account.  You can obtain anyone's public keys on GitHub via their api.  For example, to get the instructor's public key run `curl https://github.com/ktarplee.keys` or browse to it [here](https://github.com/ktarplee.keys).  Replace `ktarplee` with your username and ensure you can download your public key(s).
1. Go to your user dashboard and create a new repository. Experiment with the features within that repository to familiarize yourself with them.  Try cloning your repository with HTTPS and with SSH to observe the difference.
1. Use Git to clone your repository to your computer.
1. Create a new markdown file in this repository called `Expectations.md` at the top level of the repository. In the file please describe your expectations for the course.  To get started please answer these questions: What you expect to get out of this course?  What you are most looking forward to in the course?  Why you are taking the course?  There are not wrong answers to this, only incorrect markdown formatting.  Please use section headers and bulleted or numbered lists in your writeup.
1. Use Git to commit and push your changes to GitHub.com so they show up when viewed in a web browser.
1. Make sure your markdown file passes the markdown linter.  View the GitHub Actions for your assignment to see any errors.
1. (Extra Credit) Make at least one signed commit in your assignment.  This commit must show up as a "verified" commit on GitHub to receive extra credit.  The documentation for signing your commits is [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/about-commit-signature-verification).
